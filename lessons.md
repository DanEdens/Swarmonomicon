## Code Integration and Error Handling
- When integrating with existing tools like TodoTool, ensure proper error handling and type conversion using anyhow::Error
- Be mindful of async/await usage - not all functions need to be async even in an async context
- When using traits (like ToolExecutor), remember to import them into scope
- Error handling in Rust requires careful attention to error type conversion, especially when dealing with multiple error types
