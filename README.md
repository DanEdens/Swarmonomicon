# Swarmonomicon: The Mad Tinker's Codex


![Cover Art](docs/assets/Cover-Art.jpeg)

üõ†Ô∏è Welcome to the Swarmonomicon,\
A fusion of meticulous craftsmanship and heavily version controlled chaos.\
Inspired by OpenAI's Realtime Agents Demo, this project doesn't just reimagine agent collaboration‚Äî\
It invites you to dive headfirst into the Uncharted üåÄ and the Unhinged. ü§ñü¶æ

Here, Rust-powered agents weave intricate patterns of logic, improvisation, and mischief.\
It's a spellbook for Mad Tinkerers ready to push boundaries and embrace the unpredictable.\
Throw UX in the trash, grab an extra keyboard, a bin of raspiberries and Buckle up.

‚öôÔ∏è Tinker responsibly. \
Some assembly required[^1].\
Unintended Hilarity guaranteed[^2].


[^1]: Always assume "some" means "extensive" when dealing with Tinkers.

[^2]: May cause mqtt related restructuring of your entire codebase[^3].

[^3]: You're welcome, this is a feature not a bug.

- Real-time Communication:
  - WebSocket support for live updates
  - Agent-to-agent communication
  - Task delegation between agents
  - Intelligent task routing based on enhanced descriptions

- Extensible Architecture:
  - Easy to add new agents (This is a huge exaggeration lol. Agents NEVER get carried away.. xD)
  - Configurable task processing intervals (WIP)
  - Support for agent-specific state machines (experimental)
  - Flexible message routing
  - AI-enhanced task processing capabilities
  - Fallback mechanisms for AI enhancement failures


## Inspiration and Credits

This project is a Rust reimplementation inspired by the [OpenAI Realtime Agents Demo](https://github.com/openai/openai-realtime-agents). The original project, created by [Noah MacCallum](https://x.com/noahmacca)] and [Ilan Bigio](https://github.com/ibigio), demonstrates advanced agentic patterns built on top of a Realtime API.
My version is designed with plans to later become a [Tinker](https://github.com/DanEdens/Tinker) module.
Much of the theming ideas stem from [J.S. Morin's Twinborn and Black Ocean universes](https://www.jsmorin.com/)

### Original Project Highlights

## Subrepo Structure

Welcome, the few and the Mad, to the wondrous world of subrepos!\
This project is but a cog in the grand machine of the [Madness Interactive](https://github.com/DanEdens/madness_interactive) repository‚Äî\
A playground for my various Mad Science and other monstrosities of Automation.\
Embrace the mess of modular development, each project is but a part of the glorious, interconnected ***machine***.

Ferrum Corde!

## Features

- Agent-based architecture for modular task handling
- Tool registry for extensible functionality
- State machine support for complex workflows
- WebSocket API for real-time communication
- CLI interface for common operations

### Git Operations

The framework includes a Git assistant agent that can be used via CLI:

```bash
# Auto-generate commit message
swarm git

# Commit with specific message
swarm git -m "feat: add new feature"

# Create and switch to new branch
swarm git -b feature/new-branch

# Merge current branch into target
swarm git -t main
```

The Git assistant uses AI to generate meaningful commit messages based on the changes in your working directory.

## API Endpoints

### Agent Management
- `GET /api/agents` - List all available agents
- `GET /api/agents/:name` - Get details about a specific agent
- `POST /api/agents/:name/message` - Send a message to an agent
- `POST /api/agents/:name/send` - Send a command to an agent

### Task Management
- `GET /api/agents/:name/tasks` - Get all tasks for an agent
- `POST /api/agents/:name/tasks` - Add a task to an agent's todo list
- `GET /api/agents/:name/tasks/:task_id` - Get details about a specific task

### WebSocket
- `GET /ws` - WebSocket endpoint for real-time communication

## Task System

### Task Priority Levels
- Critical: Highest priority tasks that need immediate attention
- High: Important tasks that should be processed soon
- Medium: Regular priority tasks
- Low: Background tasks that can wait

### Task Status Flow
1. Pending: Task has been added to the todo list
2. InProgress: Task is currently being processed
3. Completed: Task has been successfully completed
4. Failed: Task processing failed

### Task Structure
```rust
pub struct TodoTask {
    pub id: String,
    pub description: String,           // Original task description
    pub enhanced_description: Option<String>,  // AI-enhanced version with additional context
    pub priority: TaskPriority,
    pub source_agent: Option<String>,
    pub target_agent: String,
    pub status: TaskStatus,
    pub created_at: i64,
    pub completed_at: Option<i64>,
}
```

### AI Enhancement Features
- Automatic task description enhancement using AI
- Preservation of both original and enhanced descriptions
- Context-aware priority assignment based on task content
- Intelligent task routing based on enhanced descriptions
- Fallback to original descriptions when AI enhancement fails

The system uses AI to:
1. Expand task descriptions with relevant technical details
2. Identify task impact and scope
3. Include related components and systems
4. Assign appropriate priority levels
5. Maintain concise but comprehensive descriptions

This dual-description approach ensures compatibility with existing tools while providing richer context for task processing.

## Usage

### Starting the Server
```bash
cargo run --bin swarm
```

### Adding a Task via API
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/agents/greeter/tasks \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "description": "Welcome new user John",
    "priority": "High",
    "source_agent": null
  }'
```

The response will include both the original and AI-enhanced descriptions:
```json
{
  "id": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
  "description": "Welcome new user John",
  "enhanced_description": "Initiate personalized welcome sequence for new user John, including system introduction and available agent overview. Ensure proper onboarding experience and gather initial user preferences for future interactions.",
  "priority": "High",
  "source_agent": null,
  "target_agent": "greeter",
  "status": "Pending",
  "created_at": 1677721600,
  "completed_at": null
}
```

### Getting Tasks for an Agent
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/agents/greeter/tasks
```

## Development

### Prerequisites
- Rust 1.70 or higher
- Cargo
- Optional: Chrome/Chromium (for browser automation features)

### Building
```bash
cargo build
```

### Running Tests
```bash
cargo test
```

### Feature Flags
- `git-agent`: Enable Git assistant functionality
- `haiku-agent`: Enable Haiku generation
- `greeter-agent`: Enable Greeter agent
- `browser-agent`: Enable browser automation
- `project-init-agent`: Enable project initialization

## Architecture

The system uses a modular architecture where each agent is an independent entity that can:
1. Process messages directly
2. Handle tasks asynchronously
3. Delegate work to other agents
4. Maintain its own state and todo list

Each agent runs in its own async task, processing its todo list at configurable intervals. This allows for true parallel processing and independent operation.

## MCP Topic Routing

Added support for subscribing to `mcp/*` topics in the MCP Todo Server and routing todos to the appropriate target agent based on the topic path.

Changes made:
- Updated the MQTT subscription in `mcp_todo_server.rs` from `mcp/todo` to `mcp/*` to subscribe to all mcp topics
- Parse the topic path from received messages and pass it to the `TodoTool.add_todo()` method as the `target_agent` parameter
- Modified the `TodoTool.add_todo()` method to accept a `target_agent` parameter and use it when creating new `TodoTask` instances
- Fixed a "temporary value dropped while borrowed" error in `todo.rs` by assigning the default `target_agent` value to a variable before using it in `unwrap_or()`

These changes allow for more flexible routing of todos based on the MQTT topic they are published to. The target agent can be determined from the topic path.
