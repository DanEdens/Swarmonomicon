# Swarmonomicon Architecture

## Overview
Swarmonomicon is a multi-agent system that coordinates different specialized agents to handle various tasks like git operations, project initialization, and creative content generation. The system uses a transfer service to manage communication between agents and maintains a global registry of available agents.

## Core Components

### 1. Agent System ✅
- **Base Agent Trait**: Defines core functionality all agents must implement
  - Message processing ✅
  - Tool handling ✅
  - State management ✅
  - Configuration ✅
- **Implementation Status**:
  - Base trait well-defined with async methods
  - Tool execution system in place
  - State machine implementation needs improvement
  - Configuration system works but needs better validation

### 2. Registry System ✅
- **Global Registry**: Maintains references to all available agents
  - Thread-safe access via `Arc<RwLock<AgentRegistry>>` ✅
  - Dynamic agent registration ✅
  - Agent lookup by name ✅
- **Implementation Status**:
  - Fully implemented with proper concurrency control
  - Good test coverage
  - Could benefit from better error handling on registration

### 3. Transfer Service 🔄
- **State Machine**: Manages transitions between agents
  - Basic transitions working ✅
  - Complex workflows need improvement ⚠️
  - State validation incomplete ⚠️
- **Message Routing**: Directs messages to appropriate agents ✅
- **Context Preservation**: Maintains context across agent transfers ⚠️
- **Implementation Status**:
  - Basic transfer functionality works
  - State preservation needs improvement
  - Error handling could be more robust
  - Missing proper validation for circular transfers

### 4. AI Communication Layer ✅
- **Centralized AI Client**: Manages all LLM interactions
  - Configurable endpoint (default: local LM Studio) ✅
  - Consistent message formatting ✅
  - Conversation history management ✅
  - System prompt handling ✅
  - Model configuration ✅
- **Implementation Status**:
  - Well-implemented with proper abstraction
  - Good error handling
  - Rate limiting added
  - Proper resource management
  - Could use better model fallback strategies

### 5. Specialized Agents
1. **Git Assistant Agent** ✅
   - Handles git operations ✅
   - Generates commit messages using AI ✅
   - Manages branches and merges ✅
   - Implementation complete with good test coverage

2. **Project Init Agent** ⚠️
   - Creates new project structures ✅
   - Sets up configuration files ⚠️
   - Initializes git repositories ✅
   - Needs better template management

3. **Haiku Agent** ❌
   - Generates creative content ⚠️
   - Integrates with git for committing haikus ❌
   - Currently using GreeterAgent as stand-in
   - Needs complete reimplementation

4. **Greeter Agent** ✅
   - Entry point for user interaction ✅
   - Command routing ✅
   - Help system ✅
   - AI-powered conversation management ✅
   - Well implemented with good test coverage
