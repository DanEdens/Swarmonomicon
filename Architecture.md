# Swarmonomicon Architecture

## Overview
Swarmonomicon is a multi-agent system that coordinates different specialized agents to handle various tasks like git operations, project initialization, and creative content generation. The system uses a transfer service to manage communication between agents and maintains a global registry of available agents.
