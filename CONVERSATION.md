# Development Conversation: Adding Model Persistence

## Current Task: Implementing Model Saving/Loading for Q-Learning Agent

### Initial Analysis
- Need to add serialization support for Q-table in QLearningAgent
- Should save model periodically during training
- Need to handle loading saved models for continued training or evaluation
- Update TODO.md to track this feature implementation

### Implementation Plan
1. Add serde support for model state
   - Q-table serialization
   - Training parameters (learning rate, discount factor, epsilon)
   - Training statistics (episodes, best score)

2. Create save/load functionality
   - Implement save_model() and load_model() methods
   - Add periodic saving during training
   - Handle file paths and versioning

3. Update training binary
   - Add command-line arguments for loading models
   - Add configuration for save frequency
   - Add option to run in evaluation mode

4. Testing
   - Add unit tests for serialization
   - Add integration tests for save/load functionality
   - Test continued training from loaded models

### Progress Updates

#### 2024-02-12: Initial Setup
1. ✅ Updated TODO.md to track model persistence feature
2. ✅ Added serde dependencies to Cargo.toml
   - Added serde with derive feature
   - Added serde_json for JSON serialization
   - Gated behind rl feature flag

#### 2024-02-12: Implementing Model Serialization
1. ✅ Created model.rs module with serialization support:
   - Implemented QModelMetadata for training statistics
   - Implemented QModel for Q-table serialization
   - Added save/load functionality with JSON format
   - Added unit tests for serialization/deserialization

2. ✅ Updated QLearningAgent with model persistence:
   - Added save_model and load_model methods
   - Integrated with QModel for serialization
   - TODO: Track episodes_trained and best_score

3. Next steps:
   - Update training binary to support model persistence:
     ```rust
     use clap::{Parser, Subcommand};

     #[derive(Parser)]
     struct Args {
         #[command(subcommand)]
         command: Command,
     }

     #[derive(Subcommand)]
     enum Command {
         Train {
             #[arg(long)]
             model_path: Option<String>,
             #[arg(long, default_value = "100")]
             save_interval: i32,
         },
         Evaluate {
             #[arg(long)]
             model_path: String,
         },
     }
     ```

4. Implementation notes:
   - Using JSON format for better readability and debugging
   - Consider adding compression for large models later
   - Need to handle model versioning for future updates
   - Consider adding model validation on load
