# Development Conversation: Adding Model Persistence

## Current Task: Implementing Model Saving/Loading for Q-Learning Agent

### Initial Analysis
- Need to add serialization support for Q-table in QLearningAgent
- Should save model periodically during training
- Need to handle loading saved models for continued training or evaluation
- Update TODO.md to track this feature implementation

### Implementation Plan
1. Add serde support for model state
   - Q-table serialization
   - Training parameters (learning rate, discount factor, epsilon)
   - Training statistics (episodes, best score)

2. Create save/load functionality
   - Implement save_model() and load_model() methods
   - Add periodic saving during training
   - Handle file paths and versioning

3. Update training binary
   - Add command-line arguments for loading models
   - Add configuration for save frequency
   - Add option to run in evaluation mode

4. Testing
   - Add unit tests for serialization
   - Add integration tests for save/load functionality
   - Test continued training from loaded models

### Progress Updates

#### 2024-02-12: Initial Setup
1. ✅ Updated TODO.md to track model persistence feature
2. ✅ Added serde dependencies to Cargo.toml
   - Added serde with derive feature
   - Added serde_json for JSON serialization
   - Gated behind rl feature flag

#### Current Implementation: Adding Serialization Support
1. Design model serialization structure:
   ```rust
   #[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]
   pub struct QModelMetadata {
       version: String,
       episodes_trained: i32,
       best_score: i32,
       learning_rate: f64,
       discount_factor: f64,
       epsilon: f64,
   }

   #[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]
   pub struct QModel<S: State, A: Action> {
       metadata: QModelMetadata,
       q_table: HashMap<(S, A), f64>,
   }
   ```

2. Next steps:
   - Implement serialization for State and Action traits
   - Add QModel implementation with save/load methods
   - Update QLearningAgent to use QModel for persistence
   - Add unit tests for serialization/deserialization

3. Implementation considerations:
   - Need to ensure State and Action types are serializable
   - Consider using bincode for more efficient binary serialization
   - Add error handling for file I/O operations
   - Consider compression for large Q-tables
