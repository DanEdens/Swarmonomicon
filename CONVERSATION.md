# Development Conversation: Adding Model Persistence

## Current Task: Implementing Model Saving/Loading for Q-Learning Agent

### Initial Analysis
- Need to add serialization support for Q-table in QLearningAgent
- Should save model periodically during training
- Need to handle loading saved models for continued training or evaluation
- Update TODO.md to track this feature implementation

### Implementation Plan
1. Add serde support for model state
   - Q-table serialization
   - Training parameters (learning rate, discount factor, epsilon)
   - Training statistics (episodes, best score)

2. Create save/load functionality
   - Implement save_model() and load_model() methods
   - Add periodic saving during training
   - Handle file paths and versioning

3. Update training binary
   - Add command-line arguments for loading models
   - Add configuration for save frequency
   - Add option to run in evaluation mode

4. Testing
   - Add unit tests for serialization
   - Add integration tests for save/load functionality
   - Test continued training from loaded models

### Progress Updates

#### 2024-02-12: Initial Setup
1. ✅ Updated TODO.md to track model persistence feature
2. ✅ Added serde dependencies to Cargo.toml
   - Added serde with derive feature
   - Added serde_json for JSON serialization (made optional)
   - Gated behind rl feature flag

#### 2024-02-12: Implementing Model Serialization
1. ✅ Created model.rs module with serialization support:
   - Implemented QModelMetadata for training statistics
   - Implemented QModel for Q-table serialization
   - Added save/load functionality with JSON format
   - Added unit tests for serialization/deserialization
   - Fixed serialization issues with proper trait bounds

2. ✅ Updated QLearningAgent with model persistence:
   - Added save_model and load_model methods
   - Integrated with QModel for serialization
   - Added tracking for episodes_trained and best_score

3. ✅ Updated training binary with model persistence support:
   - Added command-line arguments using clap:
     - `--load-model`: Path to load a saved model from
     - `--save-model`: Path to save the model to
     - `--episodes`: Number of episodes to train for
     - `--save-interval`: Save model every N episodes
     - `--render-interval`: Render visualization every N episodes
   - Implemented periodic model saving
   - Added final model saving on completion
   - Added proper error handling for save/load operations

### Next Steps
1. Testing
   - Add integration tests for model persistence
   - Test continued training from saved models
   - Verify model versioning works correctly

2. Documentation
   - Update README.md with model persistence usage
   - Document command-line arguments
   - Add examples of saving/loading models

3. Future Improvements
   - Consider adding compression for large models
   - Add model validation on load
   - Add support for different serialization formats
   - Implement automatic backup of previous model versions

### Technical Notes
1. Serialization Implementation:
   - Used separate serialization structs to handle lifetime and trait bounds
   - Added proper trait bounds (Eq + Hash) for HashMap keys
   - Used DeserializeOwned to avoid lifetime issues
   - Implemented custom serialization/deserialization to handle generic types

2. Error Handling:
   - Used proper error propagation with Result types
   - Added descriptive error messages
   - Implemented graceful error handling in the training binary

3. Performance Considerations:
   - Used pretty-printing for better debugging
   - Considered future compression support
   - Implemented efficient serialization with references
