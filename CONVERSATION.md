# Development Conversation: Adding Model Persistence

## Current Task: Implementing Model Saving/Loading for Q-Learning Agent

### Initial Analysis
- Need to add serialization support for Q-table in QLearningAgent
- Should save model periodically during training
- Need to handle loading saved models for continued training or evaluation
- Update TODO.md to track this feature implementation

### Implementation Plan
1. Add serde support for model state
   - Q-table serialization
   - Training parameters (learning rate, discount factor, epsilon)
   - Training statistics (episodes, best score)

2. Create save/load functionality
   - Implement save_model() and load_model() methods
   - Add periodic saving during training
   - Handle file paths and versioning

3. Update training binary
   - Add command-line arguments for loading models
   - Add configuration for save frequency
   - Add option to run in evaluation mode

4. Testing
   - Add unit tests for serialization
   - Add integration tests for save/load functionality
   - Test continued training from loaded models

### Progress Updates
Starting implementation of model persistence functionality. Will track changes and decisions here as we progress.

Next steps:
1. Add serde feature to Cargo.toml for the RL module
2. Implement serialization for QLearningAgent
3. Add save/load methods
4. Update training binary with persistence support
