## Current Sprint

### High Priority
- [ ] Fix failing tests
  - [x] `test_agent_registry` passing
  - [ ] Fix `test_todo_list_endpoints`
  - [ ] Fix `test_handle_transfer`
  - [ ] Fix `test_goose_tool`
  - [ ] Fix `test_state_transitions`
- [ ] Fix HaikuAgent implementation
  - [ ] Implement proper HaikuAgent instead of using GreeterAgent as stand-in
  - [ ] Add haiku generation logic
  - [ ] Add proper state transitions
- [ ] Improve error handling
  - [ ] Add better error messages for agent transfers
  - [ ] Improve error handling in websocket communication
  - [ ] Add error recovery mechanisms for AI client failures

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Enhance Agent System
  - [ ] Improve conversation context preservation
  - [ ] Add more sophisticated state machine transitions
  - [ ] Implement proper agent personality traits
  - [ ] Add support for agent-specific tools
- [ ] Task System Improvements
  - [ ] Update todo_worker to keep better task records
  - [ ] Add task logging
  - [ ] Implement task prioritization logic
  - [ ] Add task delegation between agents

### Low Priority
- [ ] Documentation
  - [ ] Add API documentation
  - [ ] Update architecture diagrams
  - [ ] Add examples for common use cases
- [ ] Testing
  - [ ] Add more unit tests
  - [ ] Add integration tests
  - [ ] Add performance benchmarks

## Completed ‚úÖ
- [x] Basic agent system with registry and transfer capabilities
- [x] Websocket communication layer
- [x] REST API endpoints for agent management
- [x] Tool system with support for custom executors
- [x] Configuration management for agents and tools
- [x] Centralized AI client with LM Studio integration
- [x] Git operations with AI-powered commit messages
- [x] Basic GreeterAgent implementation

## Lessons Learned üìù
1. Agent implementation requires careful consideration of state management
2. Test setup needs to properly mock AI client behavior
3. Websocket handling needs robust error recovery
4. Agent transfers need better validation and error handling
5. Todo list implementation needs to be more robust for concurrent access

## Next Steps üöÄ
1. Focus on fixing failing tests one by one
2. Implement proper HaikuAgent
3. Improve error handling across the system
4. Add better logging and monitoring
5. Enhance task management system
