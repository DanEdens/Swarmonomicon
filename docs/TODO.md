## Lessons Learned üìù
1. Agent implementation requires careful consideration of state management
2. Test setup needs to properly mock AI client behavior
3. Websocket handling needs robust error recovery
4. Agent transfers need better validation and error handling
5. Todo list implementation needs to be more robust for concurrent access
6. Test databases should be properly isolated and cleaned up
7. MongoDB connections should be maintained throughout test lifecycle
8. Mock implementations should match real implementations closely
9. Rate limiting is essential for system stability
10. Resource cleanup should use RAII patterns
11. Concurrent processing requires careful monitoring

## Next Steps üöÄ
1. Focus on fixing remaining failing tests one by one
2. Implement proper HaikuAgent
3. Improve error handling across the system
4. Add better logging and monitoring
5. Set up task processing metrics
6. Consider adding transaction support for critical database operations
7. Improve test isolation and cleanup procedures
8. Add more comprehensive error recovery mechanisms
9. Implement task processing dashboard
10. Add system health monitoring
