## Lessons Learned üìù
1. Agent implementation requires careful consideration of state management
2. Test setup needs to properly mock AI client behavior
3. Websocket handling needs robust error recovery
4. Agent transfers need better validation and error handling
5. Todo list implementation needs to be more robust for concurrent access
6. Test databases should be properly isolated and cleaned up
7. MongoDB connections should be maintained throughout test lifecycle
8. Mock implementations should match real implementations closely
9. Rate limiting is essential for system stability
10. Resource cleanup should use RAII patterns
11. Concurrent processing requires careful monitoring
12. State persistence is crucial for system reliability
13. Template management needs proper abstraction
